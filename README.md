# Skill-Swap
Developed for Black Wings Hack Hackathon 2024 assoc with Rewriting the Code

# Inspiration
The Skill Swap Platform was inspired by the recognition that many individuals face significant barriers when trying to access services and learn new skills, primarily due to financial constraints. This platform aims to dismantle those barriers, making it easier for everyone to access the services they need by leveraging the skills they already have. It's about creating a community-driven environment where knowledge and services can be exchanged freely, fostering inclusivity and mutual support.

# How it works
The Skill Swap Platform facilitates connections between people within the same zip code who possess complementary skills. This innovative approach allows individuals to offer their own skills in exchange for the skills they need, without involving monetary transactions. Whether it's tutoring for gardening or graphic design for web development, the platform offers a versatile and direct way for community members to support each other.
